# 🔐 Login Flow - Fixed!

## What Was the Issue?

Users need to verify their email before they can log in. The test user we created earlier wasn't verified, causing login to fail with:
```
"User email not verified. Please check your email."
```

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated LoginScreen
- ✅ Better error handling for unverified users
- ✅ Shows "Resend Verification Code" button when email not verified
- ✅ Clearer error messages

### 2. Created Verification Helper Script
- ✅ `verify-user.sh` - Manually verify users for testing
- ✅ Bypasses email verification (useful for development)

### 3. Verified Test User
- ✅ `test@chronicle.com` is now verified and can log in

## How to Use

### For New Users (Normal Flow)

1. **Sign Up**:
   - Enter email and password
   - Click "Create Account"
   - Check email for verification code

2. **Verify Email**:
   - Enter 6-digit code from email
   - Click "Verify Email"

3. **Login**:
   - Enter email and password
   - Click "Log In"
   - Navigate to Home screen

### For Testing (Quick Verification)

If you need to verify a user without checking email:

```bash
./verify-user.sh user@example.com
```

This will:
- Bypass email verification
- Allow immediate login
- Useful for testing
