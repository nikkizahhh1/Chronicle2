## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign up new user
- [ ] Verify email
- [ ] Login
- [ ] Complete interest quiz
- [ ] Create location-based trip
- [ ] View trip on Home screen
- [ ] Edit trip activities
- [ ] Delete a trip
- [ ] Create road trip
- [ ] View trip on map
- [ ] Upload profile photo

## Known Limitations

1. **Maps in Expo Go**: Shows placeholder (need dev build for full maps)
2. **PDF Export**: Placeholder (needs PDF library)
3. **Friends Backend**: UI ready, needs backend endpoints
4. **Travel Diary Backend**: UI ready, needs backend endpoints

These are minor features that can be added later.

---

## Cost Estimate

**AWS Free Tier** covers:
- Lambda: 1M requests/month
- API Gateway: 1M requests/month
- DynamoDB: 25GB storage
- Cognito: 50,000 users
- S3: 5GB storage

**Expected**: $0-5/month for development
